        <p className="p-style">
          Clear Aligners are transparent plastic trays designed to gradually
          shift your teeth into their ideal positions. Unlike metal braces,
          these aligners are virtually invisible and can be easily removed for
          eating and cleaning. They have become increasingly popular due to
          their convenience, aesthetics, and effectiveness.
